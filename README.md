# Astrido Fleet Companion

## Background
Since July 2022, Toyota has introduced the **T-Care After-Sales Program** across all official Toyota workshops.  
This program was designed to enhance customer satisfaction by providing two key benefits:
- Free service and spare parts for up to **7 periodic services**, or within **3 years / 60,000 km**.  
- **Extended Warranty** for 1 year / 20,000 km, provided that customers consistently perform maintenance every 6 months.  
Despite these significant benefits, the implementation of T-Care at **Astrido Toyota Karawaci** during the period of **January‚ÄìMarch 2024** was not optimal.  
The claim rate remained relatively low:
- 1st Service: 84%  
- 2nd Service: 86%  
- 3rd Service: 89%  
Further analysis indicated that **Fleet Customers** were the primary factor hindering the achievement of T-Care claim targets.
This situation directly affects fleet customers, as they risk losing their entitlement to the **Extended Warranty**, which protects the long-term value of their vehicles.
### Fleet Customer Composition at Astrido Toyota Karawaci:
- PT. Mitra Pinasthika Mustika Rent (MPM Rent) ‚Äì 81%  
- PT. Autorent Lancar Sejahtera ‚Äì 6%  
- PT. Bestindo Cakra Utama ‚Äì 3%  
- PT. Anugrah Inti Abadi ‚Äì 2%  
- Others ‚Äì 9%  
As a follow-up, the team conducted a visit to **MPM Rent**.  
From the discussion, several key challenges were identified that contributed to the low T-Care claims:
- Pool Managers & Management had **no visibility** into Toyota units‚Äô claim status.  
- There was **no routine monitoring system** for T-Care claims.  
- Pool Managers had **no KPI related to T-Care**, and Management had not assigned them responsibility to ensure all units submitted claims.
